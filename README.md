# Auction-Algorithm
This project needs to be contextualized in an algorithmic environment, the problem
addressed is to implement a matching algorithm in particular an auction
algorithm that works on any undirected weighted graph. One of the main goals
was to interact with the Boost Graph Library, consequently in this paper we will
focus on the following subjects: \
− an introduction to the Boost Graph Library \
− a little of graph theory \
− and finally how we addressed the problem it self. \
